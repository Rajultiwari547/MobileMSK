This repository provides a practical demonstration of live video recognition of 7 different yoga poses using PoseNet, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that detects joints and skeletal connections. The poses are classified using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. The repository includes code for data preparation, such as resizing images and creating videos, although these are not necessary for using the repository. The "static" folder contains audio and image files used in the websites, while the "p5" library offers animation and graphics capabilities in JavaScript.

The "train" folder contains code for training the KNN classifier, including a user interface (UI) for interactive training. The "test" folder includes prediction code and a JSON file with the trained model. The classifier utilizes the "drawKeypoints()" and "drawSkeletons()" functions to identify joints and skeletal structures, displaying them as ellipses and lines respectively over the webcam feed. The classifier predicts confidence levels for each pose and labels the result as the pose with the highest confidence, with an accuracy of 75% as claimed by the repository creator.

The repository also includes templates and code for two websites: one for training the model and another for pose prediction. These websites are built using Django. However, there are issues with the "requirements.txt" file, as it contains dependencies with incorrect installation commands. This can be easily fixed by modifying the "requirements.txt" file to include the correct dependencies. To run the application, the required dependencies must be installed, the server can be started using "manage.py," and the website can be accessed at the provided local address.

The training website allows users to feed examples of different poses to the model using buttons. Once the training is complete, a JSON file with the trained model can be downloaded. On the prediction website, users are prompted to grant access to their webcams, enabling PoseNet to identify joints and skeletons in real-time. The model then predicts the pose being performed from the live webcam feed.

In summary, the yoga-pose-detector repository offers a useful application for predicting yoga poses from live video, utilizing the capabilities of PoseNet.Ive downloaded and installed all the files previously while i was attempting the assignment.Ive set the directory for the cloned repository to be my desktop so it would be easy for me to operate,for this i downloaded all the raw files and saved it to mydesktop.
