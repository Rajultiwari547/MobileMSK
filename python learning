In the Python course, I learned the fundamentals of the Python programming language.
I gained a solid understanding of variables, data types, control flow, and basic coding concepts.
I explored more advanced topics like functions, modules, and file handling.
I learned about lists, list methods, and tuples and how lists and tuple differ from each other
